# A Whale off the Port(folio)

## Project Background
The investment division of Harold's company has been investing in algorithmic trading strategies. Some of the investment managers love them, some hate them, but they all think their way is best.

Harold has come to you with a challengeâ€”to help him determine which portfolio is performing the best across many areas: volatility, returns, risk, and Sharpe ratios.

## The Project
This project is to create a tool (an analysis notebook) that analyzes and visualizes the major metrics of the portfolios across all of these areas, and determine which portfolio outperformed the others. The historical daily returns of several portfolios will be given: some from the firm's algorithmic portfolios, some that represent the portfolios of famous "whale" investors like Warren Buffett, and some from the big hedge and mutual funds.

The data will need to be prepared then conduct a quantitative, perfomance, and risk analysis on the portfolios.  Also, calculate rolling statistics of the portfolios and plot the Sharpe Ratio.

After completing the above analysis use it to create a custom portfolio of stocks and compare its performance to that of the other portfolios, as well as the larger market (S&P 500).
